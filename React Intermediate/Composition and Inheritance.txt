----------------------------------------------------
Some components don’t know their children ahead of time.
----------------------------------------------------
It is recommended that components use a special children prop to pass children elements directly into their output.
Ex: function FancyBorder(props) {
  return (
    <div className={'FancyBorder FancyBorder-' + props.color}>
      {props.children}
    </div>
  );
}
----------------------------------------------------
There are no limitations on what you can pass as props in React.
----------------------------------------------------
Sometimes we think about components as being “special cases” of other components.
----------------------------------------------------
In React, this is also achieved by composition, where a more “specific” component renders a more “generic” 
one and configures it with props.
----------------------------------------------------
Props and composition give you all the flexibility you need to customize a component’s look and behavior in an explicit and safe way.
